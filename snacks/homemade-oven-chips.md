# Homemade oven chips

## You'll need:

* Olive oil
* ~2 potatoes / serve
  * I've used several varieties but like Agria potatoes the most for this
* A large bowl
* Baking tray
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 220 C (~420 F)
2. Slice potatoes into your preferred chip shape.
  - I do this by slicing them in half to start, into quarters for larger potatoes, and then making the needed additional slices.
3. Place sliced potatoes into the large bowl, and drizzle generously with olive oil. Toss, allowing the oil to distribute onto all the chips.
4. Lay chips on a single, flat layer on a baking tray. Add a little salt and pepper to taste.
5. Cook chips for 15 minutes, flip them (optionally add a bit more salt and pepper), and cook them for a further 15 minutes.
6. Remove from oven, and serve.
