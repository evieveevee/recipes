# Homemade chips

## You'll need:

* A deep fryer
* Oil for the deep fryer
  * I use canola oil
* ~2 potatoes / serve
  * I've used several varieties but like Agria potatoes the most for this
* Freezer bags (or other freezer storage)
* A large bowl (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Pre-preparation

1. Pre-heat deep-fryer to 180 C (~360 F).
2. Slice potatoes into your preferred chip shape.
  - I do this by slicing them in half to start, into quarters for larger potatoes, and then making the needed additional slices.
3. Place sliced potatoes into the fully heated fryer, and cook for two minutes.
4. Remove from oil, and allow oil to drip off.
5. Place partially cooked (blanched) chips into freezer storage and freeze until needed.

### Directions

1. Pre-heat deep fryer to 180 C (~360 F).
2. Place partially cooked (blanched) chips into deep fryer, and cook for 6-8 minutes, according to personal preference. If you want crispier chips, cook them for longer.
3. Remove from oil, and allow oil to drip off.
4. (Optional, but recommended) Place all cooked chips into a large bowl; add salt and pepper to taste. Toss them to distribute the salt and pepper, and serve.
